Build a user-facing application for your data service API. It should look/behave a lot like a traditional application, but it will in fact be using AJAX to perform most actions.

This entire application will only need HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There is no Ruby component at all.

Your homepage should show all assignments. Use an AJAX request to your [running] Sinatra server to get JSON containing assignment info, and write the content to the DOM in a sensible way.

(You'll need to allow access from other domains to allow this: https://github.com/britg/sinatra-cross_origin)

When you click on one of the assignments on the homepage, use AJAX to get that assignment's info from the data service and load it into the DOM.

Continue to build out AJAX interactions for 3 additional actions supported by the API.
